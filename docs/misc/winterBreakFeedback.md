###CLIENT Users
 - When clicking “Edit Profile”, a message in a yellow box displays at the top of the page: “You aren’t allowed to 
 access that page.  Click “here” to login with a different account.” I would at least like clients to be able to change 
 their email addresses in that tab. 

###Make a Reservation tab
 - It’s minor, but could “Please submit all trip requests at least 2 days in advance.” change to “Please submit all trip 
 requests at least forty eight hours in advance.”?
 - When a user clicks, “My destination is a medical appt.” and the extra option to have a will-call return time pops up, 
 could you add, “Requests for will calls are not accepted after 2pm or on weekends.”
 - Trip Day Section               
  - The drop down menus for hour, minute, and am/pm under “Trip Time” all need to be at least one character wider to display 
  double digit numbers
  - Could you please add a calendar feature represented by a small calendar button directly to the right of or within the Trip 
  Day box?
  - Function—pop up a calendar window if a user clicks it so they can select from upcoming days. 
  - *Exactly like the functionality of “Request Time Off” boxes for drivers using that system actually.*
 - Big thumbs up on the historical dropdown list of “Previous addresses.”  I’m guessing this info. will write to a specific 
 place or column in our JAUNT host database when using the system?  I don’t know if you can answer that or if it’s in John’s 
 head.
  - If a client chooses a previous address from that drop down list, could you make P/U Address, P/U Unit, P/U City and P/U Zip 
  automatically inactive?
  - Even better than making those boxes inactive would be automatically populating the saved addresses to the appropriate field 
  to reassure the client that they’ve selected the right location.
 - Return Time
  - The drop down menus for hour, minute, and am/pm all need to be at least one character wider to display double digit numbers
 - The “how many people with travel on this trip” question
  - Could you break it into three different questions (displayed side-by-side if possible) with Yes or No as the only options?
    - 1. Will you be traveling with a child 6 or under on this trip?
    - 2. Will you be traveling with a personal care attendant on this trip?
    - 3. Will you be traveling with any guests on this trip?  If so, please specify how many below in the “Additional Comments” 
    section.
 - Links to our How to Ride page and FAQ page are awesome.  Thanks!

###DRIVER Users
 - Same issue with the “Edit Profile” tab not working.  Drivers should be able to change their email addresses.
 
###ADMIN Users
 - No need to make “Make a Time Off Request” available to admins.  They use a different time-off request system. 
 - Everything else is looking good for the admin side.
 
###SCHEDULER Users
 - Same issue with “Edit Profile” tab not working.
 - Everything else is looking good for now.
